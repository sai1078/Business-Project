> BEMM466 Business Project - Customer Churn Prediction
> Project Overview
This project focuses on Customer Churn Prediction in the Retail Industry. It utilizes machine learning models to predict customer behavior and identify those at risk of churn. The main goal is to provide actionable insights that can be used to improve customer retention strategies in the retail sector.

BEMM466 Business Project Report (Word Document)
Contains the detailed analysis, literature review, methodology, results, and conclusion of the research on customer churn prediction. It explains the approaches used, including traditional machine learning models and neural networks.
Python Notebook (.ipynb)
This Jupyter notebook contains the code used for the exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and visualization of results. It includes multiple models like Random Forest, XGBoost, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine (SVM), along with performance metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC, etc.).
Dataset (Excel file)
The Excel file contains the dataset required to run the Python notebook. The dataset includes customer transaction details such as demographics, purchase history, product information, and more. It has over 500,000 rows, making it suitable for predictive modeling and analytics.
Instructions for Use:
Ensure the following tools are installed:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
Required Python libraries (can be installed using the requirements.txt or manually):
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
xgboost
matplotlib
seaborn

> Steps to Run the Project:

Place the Python notebook file and Excel dataset file in the same directory.
Open the Python notebook (retail_analysis.ipynb) using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
Make sure the Excel file (dataset) is in the correct format and name as specified in the notebook (adjust file path if needed).
Run the cells sequentially to:
Load and preprocess the data.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand trends and distributions.
Train machine learning models using the dataset.
Evaluate the models and visualize the results (confusion matrix, ROC curves, etc.).

> Expected Output:

The notebook will generate several outputs, including model performance metrics, graphs, and charts that visualize the results of customer churn prediction models. The best-performing model will be highlighted based on its accuracy and F1-score.
Further Customization:

You can modify the models or parameters to see how they impact performance. You may also update the dataset if new data becomes available.
